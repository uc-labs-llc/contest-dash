  "note": "Bright and wide far-sided partial halo CME seen to the NNW in STEREO A COR2 and as a N halo (slightly to the NNE) in SOHO LASCO and GOES CCOR-1, with a very wide shock and immediately following somewhat narrower bulk, possibly with two lobes. Its source is a significant restructuring of magnetic field far behind the NW limb seen in STEREO A EUV 195 at 2025-10-25T11:05Z (and possibly a minor ejecta from behind the NW limb seen in STEREO EUVI 304 at 2025-10-25T11:15Z. Coronal signatures are also more faintly seen in GOES SUVI 284 to the NNW as fast opening of field lines behind the limb after 2025-10-25T11:30Z.",
